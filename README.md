Introduction: What is SQL?

To get introduced to SQL, we first need to know about Databases and Database Management Systems(DBMS).
Data is basically a collection of facts related to some object. A Database is a collection of small units of data arranged in a systematic manner. A Relational Database Management System is a collection of tools that allows the users to manipulate, organize and visualize the contents of a database while following some standard rules that facilitate fast response between the database and the user side.

After getting introduced to the concept of data, databases and DBMS/RDBMS, we can finally learn about SQL. SQL or Structured Query Language is basically the language that we (the user) use to communicate with the Databases and get our required interpretation of data out of it. It is used for storing, manipulating and retrieving data out of a database.

SQL Features

SQL allows us to interact with the databases and bring out/manipulate data within them. Using SQL, we can create our own databases and then add data into these databases in the form of tables.

The following functionalities can be performed on a database using SQL:

1. Create or Delete a Database.
2. Create or Alter or Delete some tables in a Database.
3. SELECT data from tables.
4. INSERT data into tables.
5. UPDATE data in tables.
6. DELETE data from tables.
7. Create Views in the database.
8. Execute various aggregate functions.
